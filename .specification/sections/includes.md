### Includes
This field is intended to allow developers to create improved deployment tools. The `includes` field is an array 
of strings where each string is a relative file path that should be included in the package zip archive. Special CI / 
CD tools can use this field along with the official fields for scripts, languages, and styles to generate the archive 
with only the desired files without needing to create an additional configuration file.

```json
"includes": [
   "relative/path/to/files/script.js", 
   "relative/path/to/templates/template.html", 
   "path/to/image/assets/folder"
]
```
