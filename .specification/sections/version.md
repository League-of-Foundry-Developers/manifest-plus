### Version
Document Version: 1.1.0

It is recommended to include a `manifestPlusVersion` field in your manifest to denote which version of Manifest+ you 
have implemented. We do not intend for breaking changes to this specification, but if they do happen we will increment 
the major version in accordance with [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).

```json
"manifestPlusVersion": "1.1.0"
```
