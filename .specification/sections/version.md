### Version
Document Version: 1.2.0

It is recommended to include a `manifestPlusVersion` field in your manifest to denote which version of Manifest+ you 
have implemented. Breaking changes are not intended for this specification, but if they do occur the major version 
will be incremented in accordance with [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).

```json
"manifestPlusVersion": "1.2.0"
```
