### What is Manifest+?

The Manifest+ specification is an unofficial community developed extension to the official Foundry VTT manifest
specification for module and system development intended to add additional data which can be used by packages within
Foundry VTT and by external applications.

You can find all the details about the Manifest+ specification on the [Foundry VTT Wiki](https://foundryvtt.wiki/en/development/manifest-plus)
